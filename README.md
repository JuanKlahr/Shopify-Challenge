# Shopify-Challenge

This project was made for the Shopify Winter 2021 Data Science Intern Challenge. Within the Challenge folder is three files
1. The Word document (.docx) that contains the two challenge questions provided by Shopify, written answers to the questions, and SQL code
2. A folder with the provided Excel file (.xlsx) for the challenge, the code to answer Question 1 of the challenge in a .py file, and a readme.txt file with helpful information in regards to using the .py file. 
3. A .sql file that contains the code to answer Question 2 of the challenge. Contents are in the Word document but .sql file is provided anyway

Thank you Shopify for your consideration
